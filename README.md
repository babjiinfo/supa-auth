# Supabase Compliance Checker

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Overview

This application helps Supabase users check and ensure compliance with best practices. It checks the following:

- **MFA**: Whether Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled for all users.
- **RLS**: Whether Row-Level Security is enabled for all tables.

The app provides options to view compliance results and log evidence, and offers an option to auto-fix certain issues.

## Features

1. **Authenticate with Supabase**

   - Authenticate users through Supabase.

2. **Run Compliance Checks**

   - **MFA Check**: List all users and determine whether MFA is enabled.
   - **RLS Check**: List all tables and determine whether Row-Level Security (RLS) is enabled.

3. **Log Evidence**

   - Collect and store logs of the checks with timestamps.

4. **Bonus Features**
   - **Auto-Fix**: Automatically fix certain compliance issues such as enabling MFA, RLS, and PITR.
   - **AI Help**: Use AI (via OpenAI or other models) to assist users in resolving compliance issues.
